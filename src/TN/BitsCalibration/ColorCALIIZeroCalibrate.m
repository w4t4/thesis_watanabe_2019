function ColorCALIIZeroCalibrate(ColorCALIICDCPort)
% Calibrate zero-level, by which to adjust subsequent measurements by.
% ColorCAL II should be covered during this period so that no light can be
% detected.

% Use the 'serial' function to assign a handle to the port ColorCAL II is
% connected to. This handle (s1 in the current example) will then be used
% to communicate with the chosen port).
s1 = serial(ColorCALIICDCPort);

% Open the ColorCAL II port so that it is open to be communicated with.
% Communication with the ColorCAL II occurs as though it were a text file.

% calibration is successful.

% It can be useful to contain codes within 'try/catch' statements so that
% if the code raises an error and aborts part way, the 'catch' can be used
% to ensure any open ports are closed properly. Aborting the script without
% closing the ports properly may prevent the port from being reopened again
% in future. If this happens, just close and reopen MATLAB.

    % being returned to the host. Note the '13' represents the terminator
    % character. 13 represents a carriage return and should be included at
