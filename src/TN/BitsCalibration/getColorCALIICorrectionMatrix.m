function myCorrectionMatrix = getColorCALIICorrectionMatrix(ColorCALIICDCPort)
% Obtains the individual correction matrix for the ColorCAL II, to be used
% to translate measured readings to calibrated XYZ values

% Use the 'serial' function to assign a handle to the port ColorCAL II is
% connected to. This handle (s1 in the current example) will then be used
% to communicate with the chosen port).
s1 = serial(ColorCALIICDCPort);

% Open the ColorCAL II port so that it is open to be communicated with.
% Communication with the ColorCAL II occurs as though it were a text file.
% Therefore to open it, use fopen.
fopen(s1);

% It can be useful to contain codes within 'try/catch' statements so that
% if the code raises an error and aborts part way, the 'catch' can be used
% to ensure any open ports are closed properly. Aborting the script without
% closing the ports properly may prevent the port from being reopened again
% in future. If this happens, just close and reopen MATLAB.
